## welcome to my site!
#### this is a site where I'll put things I'm interested in, and things I've made and worked on and created. 
I'm a student of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Universiteit Leiden, in the Netherlands. I'm especially interested in how people relate to knowledge, and the ways in which this knowledge manifests. I'm also interested in knitting, philately, and writing. I'll put all of this here.
