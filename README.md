## welcome to my site!
#### this is a site where I'll put things I'm interested in, and things I've made and worked on and created. 
I'm a student of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (CADS) at Universiteit Leiden, in the Netherlands. I'm especially interested in how people relate to knowledge, and the ways in which this knowledge manifests. I'm also interested in knitting, philately, and writing. I'll put all of this here. 

### Fieldwork 2022-2023: The Care of an Au Pair
As part of my degree in CADS, we complete a year long self-created ethnographic research project, on a topic of our choice. Together with Lila, Annika and Benjam√≠n, we studied au pairs living in the Netherlands, the work that they do, and the ways in which they are treated in their time as an au pair. From this we created a 50 page research report, finding that the mismatched expectations of those involved in the au pair industry caused a great deal of harm for everyone involved (but mainly au pairs).
