## holly zijderveld

I'm Holly, this is my personal site. I write, research, and create 🟀; I tend to collections and archives 🟄; I read 🟉; I organise events ✶; and I work on what you can maybe call publishing projects ✴.

🟀 around themes of living, connectedness, crafting, and computing
🟄 including my personal collections of stamps and postcards
🟉 especially translated fiction, and especially Clarice Lispector
✶ including lectures and workshops
✴ which you can find on [this are.na page](https://www.are.na/holly-garden/channels)

I have degrees in cultural anthropology/ethnography from the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University. Throughout my time there, I conducted research on: [Dutch au pairing and maintenance work](https://themaintainers.org/studying-the-sensible-side-of-love-in-the-netherlands/); [academic controversy surrounding sex robots](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse); [the relationship between craft and technology in the AYAB project](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research/); and [the AUTOMATH project](https://automath.win.tue.nl/). 

This site will soon, hopefully, undergo some pretty heavy reconstruction. I hope to meet you here also on the other side.

### Now
I'm a part of the [Self Model Making research group](https://supergijs.com/researchgroup.html), and I'm currently attending the [Fieldnotes Saturday School](https://fieldnotes.site/events/). I'm working on establishing a new mode of working for myself outside of the bounds of full time study, which is simultaneously freeing and a little scary. I'm enjoying where it's leading me.

### Next
I'm currently preparing some interesting things in the direction of publishing again, after I was working on the project Journal of Erato a couple of years ago (you can still read the issues online, [here](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/65812999/issue-two-hometown)). I've got two ideas I'm working on right now, and I'm really excited to share them when they're ready. In a similar vein, we (as the Self Model Making group) are currently preparing a small public moment to share what we've been exploring over the last six-or-so months. 

And following on from that, on the theme of events, I am at the very beginning of a volunteering position at Internet Archive Europe. Alongside a small team, we will produce community events to share the activities of the archive and the value of open access knowledge! It's something that I'm super excited about.
