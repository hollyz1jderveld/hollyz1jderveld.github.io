I'm Holly, this is my personal site. The following is a short impression of my life and how I spend my time: I work as a cook at a breakfast and lunch restaurant, and also enjoy cooking at home and developing my own recipes; I spend a lot of time reading, most often translated literary fiction; I also enjoy writing, but contrarily only in English; I'm interested in textiles/clothing, computing/the internet, snail mail/philately, and investigating ways that we are all wading through this life together. 

I have degrees in cultural anthropology/ethnography from the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University. Throughout my time there, I conducted research on: [Dutch au pairing and maintenance work](https://themaintainers.org/studying-the-sensible-side-of-love-in-the-netherlands/); [academic controversy surrounding sex robots](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse); [the relationship between craft and technology in the AYAB project](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research/); and [the AUTOMATH project](https://automath.win.tue.nl/). 

This site will soon, hopefully, undergo some pretty heavy reconstruction. I hope to meet you here also on the other side.

### Now
Currently, I'm preferably looking for work in developing independent community and cultural projects. I'm a part of the [Self Model Making research group](https://supergijs.com/researchgroup.html), and I'm currently attending the [Fieldnotes Saturday School](https://fieldnotes.site/events/). I'm working on establishing a new mode of working for myself outside of the bounds of full time study, which is simultaneously freeing and a little scary. I'm enjoying where it's leading me.

### Next
I'm currently preparing some interesting things in the direction of publishing again, after I was working on the project Journal of Erato a couple of years ago (you can still read the issues online, [here](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/65812999/issue-two-hometown)). I've got two ideas I'm working on right now, and I'm really excited to share them when they're ready. In a similar vain, we (as the Self Model Making group) are currently preparing a small public moment to share what we've been exploring over the last six-or-so months. 

And following on from that, on the theme of events, I am at the very beginning of a volunteering position at Internet Archive Europe. Alongside a small team, we will produce community events to share the activities of the archive and the value of open access knowledge! It's something that I'm super excited about. Besides all of these things, I'm really looking for other things to do next. If you know of any work in community development/management, communication, or event production (preferably for happy organisations and companies), I would be delighted if you'd send it forward!
