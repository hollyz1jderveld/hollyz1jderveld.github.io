## holly garden
I'm Holly Zijderveld, this is my web garden. Although, on second thought, it's very small, so maybe it's more like an allotment or a balcony or a patio.

Most generally, I am working around themes of connection, collection, and computing, in the broadest ways you can understand these terms. I interact with these ideas through writing (poetry, fiction, & essays), publishing & editing, research, event & community organising, illustration, research, and textile. These ideas also play into my work in technical research support. 

### You can see what I've been up to in my [log](https://holly.garden/log).
