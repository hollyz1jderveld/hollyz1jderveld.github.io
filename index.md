## holly zijderveld

I'm an anthropologist (researcher, writer) focusing on science, technology, craft and information. I'm interested in fibre, paper, and technology, and all of the things I can do with them. This extends to knitting, philately, writing, and archiving.

### Currently in academic endeavours

#### Automath Archive
23-11-2024 I've been working on this project for almost two months now, and it's becoming really exciting! Most of the last two months have been focussed on understanding the project a little better, talking to some people who know about it and reading survey papers written about the project. Yesterday, we started the archive research, and it was really insightful. I'm feeling very hopeful about finding some interesting and insightful things!

#### [Master's research 2024-2025](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research)
19-10-2024 I'm now well on the way with planning my research project into knitting machines and crafters, and the manifestations of the links between people, craft, and technology. I'm getting more excited by the day! I'm spending a lot of time reading and planning what I'll be doing in my fieldwork period, from January to March. I've created a website for the project, which you can find [here](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research). The process is daunting for sure, but I think that it's going well.

#### BSc Thesis 2024
??-08-2024 I recently finished writing my BSc Thesis in Cultural Anthropology & Development Sociology!! It's titled *Talking About Sex Robots: Mapping academic controversy in sex robot discourse*. Using the methodology of controversy mapping, I looked at the academic conversations and debates that have been happening around sex robots since 2007. Specifically, I look into the ways in which some arguments (made by people who oppose sex robots) resemble arguments made by second-wave anti-pornography feminists and hide transphobic/anti-sex worker beliefs underneath. You can download and read it on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse), or you can email me (address at the bottom of the page) and I'll send it over to you.

09-11-2024 Davecat, who I interviewed for the thesis, recently wrote some of his thoughts about my thesis on his blog! You can read it [here](http://www.kuroneko-chan.com/echoes/?p=6748), and I'd reccomend reading some of his other blog posts too!
