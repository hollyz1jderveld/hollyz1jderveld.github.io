## holly zijderveld

I'm Holly, this is my personal site. I write, research, and create 🟀; I tend to collections and archives 🟄; I read 🟉; I organise events ✶; and I work on what you can maybe call publishing projects ✴. 

🟀 around themes of living, connectedness, crafting, and computing / 🟄 including my personal collections of stamps and postcards / 🟉 especially translated fiction, and especially Clarice Lispector / ✶ including lectures and workshops / ✴ which you can find on [this are.na page](https://www.are.na/holly-garden/channels)

### Now
I'm a part of the [Self Model Making research group](https://supergijs.com/researchgroup.html), volunteering at [Internet Archive Europe](https://www.internetarchive.eu/), and working on the [Re/Presenting Europe project](https://re-presentingeurope.nl/). Working on writing poetry and flash fiction again, especially in a capacity that explores newer interests of mine, is feeling really good. I'm also working on establishing a new mode of working for myself outside of the bounds of full time study, which is simultaneously freeing and a little scary. It's an enjoyable process.

### Next
* * Please join us at the Internet Archive Europe on 6th November, for a [celebration of World Digital Preservation Day, with a presentation from the Internet Phone Book!](https://luma.com/hheq551u). *

I'm currently preparing some interesting things in the direction of publishing again. I've got two ideas I'm working on right now, and I'm really excited to share them when they're ready. In a similar vein, we (as the Self Model Making group) are currently preparing a small public moment to share what we've been exploring over the last six-or-so months, and we (as the [Fieldnotes Saturday School](https://fieldnotes.site/events/) September cohort) are preparing a digital publication of writing we created over the school. 

This site will soon, hopefully, undergo some pretty heavy reconstruction. I hope to meet you here also on the other side.

### Before
I have degrees in cultural anthropology/ethnography from the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University. Throughout my time there, I conducted research on: [Dutch au pairing and maintenance work](https://themaintainers.org/studying-the-sensible-side-of-love-in-the-netherlands/); [academic controversy surrounding sex robots](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse); [the relationship between craft and technology in the AYAB project](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research/); and [the AUTOMATH project](https://automath.win.tue.nl/). 

In 2020/2021 (when I was finishing high school), I published two issues of a lit mag called Journal of Erato, alongside designer [Marcus Kerr](https://marcus-kerr.com/). There was a lot I didn't know about running a publication at the time, and thus the project is pretty badly documented. However, you can still read the issues online, [here](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/65812999/issue-two-hometown). At the time, I also wrote a lot of poetry and creative work, some of which was also published by small independent publications, and which you can see listed [here](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/reading-list/).
