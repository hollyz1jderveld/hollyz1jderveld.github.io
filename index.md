## holly zijderveld

Hi, I'm Holly, welcome to my site! Right now, I am just out here, moving forward on some adventure that may seem more or less grand when I look back on it. Currently, I spend most of my time writing, researching, reading, listening to electronic music, knitting, at the gym, walking around, or seeing my friends. I'm very inspired by information systems/infrastructures, relational ways of viewing the world, and ideas of artistic/craft skill development.

### Currently in academic endeavours

#### Automath Archive
31-03-2025 It feels a lot like we're approaching the final part of this project, which is exciting! I'm not going to say too much, but I'm writing something up and also learning some new skills in html and javascript.

#### [Master's research 2024-2025](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research)
31-03-2025 Today is my last official day of fieldwork for this project. It's honestly very exciting! I have a couple more people I'd still like to speak to, to cap it all off, but now it's analysis and writing ahead of me! This is all ahead of my thesis submission, which looms (haha) of course, but I will also be presenting some findings from this research at SIEF 2025, at the University of Aberdeen in June. It's exciting!

### Currently in making
My life has very suddenly turned into writing, writing, writing on a number of different projects. It's certainly still fulfulling, but I'm hearing my knitting machine call for me!

I have also (for some reason) committed myself to making a vlog. I filmed some things, but with my mountain of writing tasks I'm finding it very difficult to do anything else creative! But maybe that will actually happen, I hope so :) Speaking of being creative on the internet, I plan to give this website a major-ish restructure come the summer, I'm taking a lot of inspriation from some [personal websites that I've been collecting in an are.na board](https://www.are.na/holly-zijderveld/personal-websites-byf_bi5u8m0). I really enjoy the very raw html feel of this site, but I'd like everything to feel just a touch more intentional. I have a pretty good idea of what I'd like to do, I think! Also, I'm planning to buy a domain as my graduation present for myself... I'm very excited.
