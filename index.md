#### This is a site where I'll put things I'm interested in, I've made, worked on, and created. 

*My profile page can be found at [https://holly.omg.lol](https://holly.omg.lol)*

In my personal life, I'm interested in fibre, paper, and technology, and all of the things I can do with them. I'm interested in knitting, philately, writing, and archiving.

Academically, I'm a student of Global Ethnography at Universiteit Leiden, in the Netherlands. I'm especially interested in how people relate to knowledge, and the ways in which this knowledge manifests materially. 

#### First and foremost, I have a blog! You can read it [here](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/blog/contents).

### Currently in academic endeavours

#### Automath Archive
02-10-2024 Alongside Rodrigo Ochigame, I am currently researching the history of (one of) the first automatic proof checkers, called Automath. It was developed from the late 1960s - early 1980s by a mathematician named N. G. de Bruijn. We're in the very early stages of this more exploratory research, as we are putting out feelers and getting an overview of what the archive situation looks like. Ideally, however, we'd like to learn more about the projects' link to mathematical philosophies such as intuitionism, and about hidden labour that may have taken place during the creation of the project. I'm really excited to get more into this project & see where it takes me!

#### [Master's research 2024-2025](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research)
19-10-2024 I'm now well on the way with planning my research project into knitting machines and crafters, and the manifestations of the links between people, craft, and technology. I'm getting more excited by the day! I'm spending a lot of time reading and planning what I'll be doing in my fieldwork period, from January to March. I've created a website for the project, which you can find [here](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research). The process is daunting for sure, but I think that it's going well.

#### BSc Thesis 2024
I recently finished writing my BSc Thesis in Cultural Anthropology & Development Sociology!! It's titled *Talking About Sex Robots: Mapping academic controversy in sex robot discourse*. Using the methodology of controversy mapping, I looked at the academic conversations and debates that have been happening around sex robots since 2007. Specifically, I look into the ways in which some arguments (made by people who oppose sex robots) resemble arguments made by second-wave anti-pornography feminists and hide transphobic/anti-sex worker beliefs underneath. You can download and read it on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse), or you can email me (address at the bottom of the page) and I'll send it over to you.

### Currently in writing

I love apps and websites to do with specific things with my hobbies. 

You can find me on [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/Midnight4225), [Postcrossing](https://www.postcrossing.com/user/Midnight4225), or [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/hollyzijderveld) to see what I knit, post, and read respectively.

You can email me @ holly[at]omg[dot]lol. If you want to contact me this is the best way to do so!

***Disclaimer*** I am a very beginner coder and web developer. This was mostly done by scratch! I'm working through it, but it means I can't often work on the website and debug for a very long time. So if something doesn't work, feel free to email me about it, but I'm probably already trying to fix it :)
