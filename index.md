## holly zijderveld

I'm Holly, this is my personal site. I write, research, and create ðŸŸ€; I tend to collections and archives ðŸŸ„; I read ðŸŸ‰; I organise events âœ¶; and I work on what you can maybe call publishing projects âœ´. 

ðŸŸ€ around themes of living, connectedness, crafting, and computing / ðŸŸ„ including my personal collections of stamps and postcards / ðŸŸ‰ especially translated fiction, and especially Clarice Lispector / âœ¶ including lectures and workshops / âœ´ which you can find on [this are.na page](https://www.are.na/holly-garden/channels)

### Before
I have degrees in cultural anthropology/ethnography from the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University. Throughout my time there, I conducted research on: [Dutch au pairing and maintenance work](https://themaintainers.org/studying-the-sensible-side-of-love-in-the-netherlands/); [academic controversy surrounding sex robots](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse); [the relationship between craft and technology in the AYAB project](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research/); and [the AUTOMATH project](https://automath.win.tue.nl/). 

In 2020/2021 (when I was finishing high school), I published two issues of a lit mag called Journal of Erato, alongside designer [Marcus Kerr](https://marcus-kerr.com/). There was a lot I didn't know about running a publication at the time, and thus the project is pretty badly documented. However, you can still read the issues online, [here](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/65812999/issue-two-hometown). At the time, I also wrote a lot of poetry and creative work, some of which was also published by small independent publications, and which you can see listed [here](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/reading-list/). 

### Now
I'm a part of the [Self Model Making research group](https://supergijs.com/researchgroup.html), and I'm currently attending the [Fieldnotes Saturday School](https://fieldnotes.site/events/). Working on writing poetry and flash fiction again, especially in a capacity that explores newer interests of mine, is feeling really good. I'm also working on establishing a new mode of working for myself outside of the bounds of full time study, which is simultaneously freeing and a little scary. It's an enjoyable process.

### Next
I'm currently preparing some interesting things in the direction of publishing again. I've got two ideas I'm working on right now, and I'm really excited to share them when they're ready. In a similar vein, we (as the Self Model Making group) are currently preparing a small public moment to share what we've been exploring over the last six-or-so months. 

And following on from that, on the theme of events, I am at the very beginning of a volunteering position at Internet Archive Europe. Alongside a small team, we will produce community events to share the activities of the archive and the value of open access knowledge! It's something that I'm super excited about. 

This site will soon, hopefully, undergo some pretty heavy reconstruction. I hope to meet you here also on the other side.
