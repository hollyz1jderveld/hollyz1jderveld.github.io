## holly zijderveld

I'm Holly, this is my personal site. The following is a short impression of my life and how I spend my time: I work as a cook at a breakfast and lunch restaurant, and also enjoy cooking at home and developing my own recipes; I spend a lot of time reading, most often translated literary fiction; I also enjoy writing, but contrarily only in English; I'm interested in textiles/clothing, computing/the internet, snail mail/philately, and investigating ways that we are all wading through this life together. 

I have degrees in cultural anthropology/ethnography from the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University. Throughout my time there, I conducted research on: [Dutch au pairing and maintenance work](https://themaintainers.org/studying-the-sensible-side-of-love-in-the-netherlands/); [academic controversy surrounding sex robots](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse); [the relationship between craft and technology in the AYAB project](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research/); and [the AUTOMATH project](https://automath.win.tue.nl/). I'm currently looking for work in developing independent community and cultural projects.

This site will soon, hopefully, undergo some pretty heavy reconstruction. I hope to meet you here also on the other side.
