Hi, I'm Holly! I'm doing ethnography, experimenting with machine knitting and other new-to-me artforms, and floating around on the internet.

### Currently in academic endeavours

#### Automath Archive
31-03-2025 It feels a lot like we're approaching the final part of this project, which is exciting! I'm not going to say too much, but I'm writing something up and also learning some new skills in html and javascript.

#### [Master's research 2024-2025](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research)
09-01-2025 I'm now officially in the fieldwork period for this project! I'm spending my time organising and doing interviews with people who modify their knitting machines, and setting up my knitting machine so that I can install the AYAB hardware in it. Of course, fieldwork always comes with fieldnotes, and I'm also spending a lot of time writing stream-of-consciousness, making sure that I get all of my thoughts out. This is my first time doing fieldwork alone so I was worried that I would feel quite lonely, but I'm feeling really good about it so far. In late January I will travel to San Francisco to meet modified machine knitters there. I'm really excited!

#### BSc Thesis 2024
??-08-2024 I recently finished writing my BSc Thesis in Cultural Anthropology & Development Sociology!! It's titled *Talking About Sex Robots: Mapping academic controversy in sex robot discourse*. Using the methodology of controversy mapping, I looked at the academic conversations and debates that have been happening around sex robots since 2007. Specifically, I look into the ways in which some arguments (made by people who oppose sex robots) resemble arguments made by second-wave anti-pornography feminists and hide transphobic/anti-sex worker beliefs underneath. You can download and read it on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse), or you can email me (address at the bottom of the page) and I'll send it over to you.

09-11-2024 Davecat, who I interviewed for the thesis, recently wrote some of his thoughts about my thesis on his blog! You can read it [here](http://www.kuroneko-chan.com/echoes/?p=6748), and I'd reccomend reading some of his other blog posts too!
