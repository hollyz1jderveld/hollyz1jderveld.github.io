## holly zijderveld

Hi, I'm Holly! Broadly, I'm a researcher looking into knowledge systems and the ways that we (people) interact with information, materials, and each other. More specifically, I study at the [Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/cultural-anthropology-and-development-sociology), I (machine) knit, I write, I collect stamps, and I listen to electronic music. Among other things. Welcome!

### Currently in academic endeavours

#### Automath Archive
31-03-2025 It feels a lot like we're approaching the final part of this project, which is exciting! I'm not going to say too much, but I'm writing something up and also learning some new skills in html and javascript.

#### [Master's research 2024-2025](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io/knitting-research)
31-03-2025 Today is my last official day of fieldwork for this project. It's honestly very exciting! I have a couple more people I'd still like to speak to, to cap it all off, but now it's analysis and writing ahead of me! This is all ahead of my thesis submission, which looms (haha) of course, but I will also be presenting some findings from this research at SIEF 2025, at the University of Aberdeen in June. It's exciting!

### Currently in making
My life has very suddenly turned into writing, writing, writing on a number of different projects. It's certainly still fulfulling, but I'm hearing my knitting machine call for me!
